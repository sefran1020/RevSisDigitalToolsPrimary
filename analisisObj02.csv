Buentello-Montoya, D.A., Lomelí-Plascencia, M.G., Medina-Herrera, L.M.;2021;Mexico, Taiwan, China, USA, Europe, Other (based on reviewed study origins );RETs generally accepted by students and show potential for improving performance and motivation, especially for abstract concepts and spatial skills. Effectiveness depends on adequate design.;"Hardware/software limitations; cost; potential for extraneous cognitive load; complicated usability/steep learning curve; need for adequate activity design; lack of teacher digital literacy/training; difficulty translating content effectively; lack of standardized measurement frameworks.";Increased Motivation (MT) and Interactivity (IN) were common goals. Students found RETs compelling, interesting, and useful. Studies aimed to increase engagement and curiosity, using interactivity to promote active learning. Motivation/satisfaction ratings increased.;RETs used to ease learning (EL)  and reduce math anxiety. AR improved performance significantly for high anxiety students. Willingness to learn can increase by raising self-efficacy and reducing anxiety. Students reported better understanding with apps.
