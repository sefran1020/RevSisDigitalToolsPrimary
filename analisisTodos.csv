Buentello-Montoya, D.A., Lomelí-Plascencia, M.G., Medina-Herrera, L.M.;2021;Mexico, Taiwan, China, USA, Europe, Other (based on reviewed study origins );Varies across reviewed studies (Total 25 studies reviewed);Elementary, High school, Undergraduate ;"Varies across reviewed studies; some focused on low/high anxiety students, students with varying spatial visualization capabilities, or students with disabilities ";Systematic review of studies employing various designs (e.g., comparative, pre/post-test, surveys) ;Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, AR books, virtual labs, visualization apps ;Traditional methods (e.g., traditional books), control groups without RETs, comparison between AR and VR ;Classroom, distance learning environments ;Pre/post tests (PPT), specific tests for spatial thinking/visualization skills ;Satisfaction surveys (SS), Likert scales, Motivation scales, Math Anxiety measures ;Cronbach's Alpha, Factor analysis ;Comparison of test scores between groups, analysis of survey ratings ;Analysis of student comments from surveys ;Not explicitly stated for reviewed studies, but review combines quantitative and qualitative findings;RETs generally accepted by students and show potential for improving performance and motivation, especially for abstract concepts and spatial skills. Effectiveness depends on adequate design.;"Performance improvement varied: e.g., 3-5% increase for low anxiety students, 25-31% for high anxiety students in specific areas; 36% higher pass rate in spatial skills for experimental group; 25% difference in geometry test scores; motivation/satisfaction increase around 13%.";"Hardware/software limitations; cost; potential for extraneous cognitive load; complicated usability/steep learning curve; need for adequate activity design; lack of teacher digital literacy/training; difficulty translating content effectively; lack of standardized measurement frameworks.";RETs used to teach Geometry (GM), Calculus, Algebra, Vectors, Arithmetic, Probability. AR improved geometry performance (high anxiety students +31%, low anxiety +5%). AR apps helped understand concepts like multiple integrals  and vector operations. VR impacted visualization of partial derivatives. Focus on improving spatial visualization.;RETs used to develop Spatial Thinking (ST). Apps transformed 2D graphs to 3D objects, visualized multivariable concepts, characterized parabolas, and allowed manipulation of vectors, improving spatial skills. No specific mention of problem-solving or computational thinking development.;Increased Motivation (MT) and Interactivity (IN) were common goals. Students found RETs compelling, interesting, and useful. Studies aimed to increase engagement and curiosity, using interactivity to promote active learning. Motivation/satisfaction ratings increased.;RETs used to ease learning (EL)  and reduce math anxiety. AR improved performance significantly for high anxiety students. Willingness to learn can increase by raising self-efficacy and reducing anxiety. Students reported better understanding with apps.;Marker-based AR apps, AR books, mobile/tablet AR, computer-based AR/VR, Head-Mounted Displays (HMD) for high immersion VR, Kinect-based interaction, virtual labs/platforms, specific software like GeoGebra AR, Second Life, OpenSimulator.;Students using RETs performed better than those using traditional books. AR shown to improve performance compared to control groups. AR particularly beneficial for high-anxiety students compared to low-anxiety ones. No statistical difference found between AR and VR user experience in one study.;Adequate design of lectures/activities is crucial for RET success. Previous preparation/lecturing for both teachers and students is important, especially if RETs are initially found complicated. Need for teacher training due to potential lack of digital literacy and resistance. Instructional design should promote conceptual understanding over rote learning.;Students' prior spatial visualization capabilities can affect outcomes. Student motivation and self-efficacy influence learning. Familiarity with technology can impact ease of use, though enthusiasm for training exists. Digital literacy levels of both students and teachers are factors. Geographic/economic factors mentioned as potential influences on research focus and resource availability (developing vs. developed countries).;Review covers 2015-June 2020. 76% reviewed studies used AR, 16% VR, 8% mixed. Most studies used low immersion AR via mobile/tablet. Increasing trend in publications observed. Research often focuses on user acceptance/satisfaction rather than detailed learning metrics. Need for standardized frameworks to measure impact beyond novelty.
