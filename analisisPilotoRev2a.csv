Cerniglia, L., Cimino, S., & Ammaniti, M.;2021;Italy;N=356 (initially N=422 selected from N=651, further reduced after exclusions). The study formed two groups based on maternal scaffolding: Scaffolding Group (SG, n=161) and Non-scaffolding Group (NSG, n=195). ;Children from 4 to 8 years of age (T0: 4 years, T1: 6 years, T2: 8 years). ;"Children who regularly used smartphones/tablets daily for educational apps/short videos and exceeded AAP recommendation of 1 hour/day; excluded children with major conditions (Autism, blindness, etc.) and those whose mothers/children exceeded clinical cut-offs on psychopathology screening. ";Three-wave longitudinal study. ;Use of digital devices (smartphones and tablets) for educational apps and short videos, with screen time exceeding AAP recommendations. Measured at T0 (4 years), with follow-ups at T1 (6 years) and T2 (8 years). ;"Comparison between children whose mothers engaged in scaffolding during screen time (Scaffolding Group - SG) versus those whose mothers did not (Non-scaffolding Group - NSG). All children in the study exceeded AAP screen time recommendations; it was not possible to form a control group of children not exceeding these recommendations. ";Mothers were administered questionnaires at their home regarding screen time and scaffolding. Teachers reported on children's academic achievements and dysregulation from kindergartens/schools across Italy. ;Teacher Report Form 6-18 (TRF) - Academic Performance T-score for Mathematics and Literacy grades. ;Teacher Report Form 6-18 (TRF) - Dysregulation Profile (DP) derived from Anxious/Depressed, Aggressive Behavior, and Attention Problems subscales. ;Modified version of the StimQ measure (including Parental Involvement in Developmental Advance - PIDA subscale) for screen time and maternal involvement. Mothers completed Symptom Checklist-90/R (SCL-90/R) and Child Behavior Checklist 1.5-5 (CBCL) for initial screening. ;Bivariate Pearson correlation analyses, MANOVAs, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using LISREL 8.80. ;N/A;N/A;Screen time at 4 years (T0) was directly, positively, and significantly associated with dysregulation at T1 (6 years) and T2 (8 years). Screen time at T0 was negatively associated with mathematics grades at T2, mediated by dysregulation at T1. Low maternal scaffolding (NSG) at T0 was highly predictive of child dysregulation at T1 and associated with lower mathematics grades at T2, mediated by dysregulation at T1 and T2. Maternal scaffolding (SG) at T0 predicted higher math and literacy grades at T1, but not T2, and also positively predicted dysregulation at T2 which was negatively associated with math grades at T2. Eta−squared(\eta^2;) for MANOVA group differences (e.g., Dysregulation T1 NSG vs SG η2=0.52). Standardized regression weights (β) for SEM paths (e.g., Screen Time T0 to Dysregulation T1 β=0.54). Path coefficients and model fit indices (NNFI, CFI, RMSEA) reported for SEM. ;Inability to form a control group of children not exceeding AAP screen time recommendations. Assessed maladaptive rather than adaptive emotional and behavioral processes. Academic results evaluated only through literacy and mathematics scores. The chosen developmental periods (6 and 8 years) are at risk for emotional/behavioral problems, meaning academic results could be impaired by other factors. ;Excessive screen time at 4 years was negatively associated with mathematics grades at 8 years, an effect mediated through increased dysregulation symptoms. Maternal scaffolding was associated with higher mathematics grades at 6 years, but this protective effect did not extend to 8 years for mathematics, and scaffolded children still showed increased dysregulation at 8 years which negatively impacted math grades. ;N/A;Not directly measured. The study focused on dysregulation, which can impact engagement, but specific instruments for motivation/engagement were not used.;Excessive screen time at 4 years was directly and positively associated with increased dysregulation symptoms (which includes an anxious/depressed component) at both 6 and 8 years. Children in the non-scaffolding group (NSG) showed higher dysregulation at T1 and T2. ;Smartphones and tablets used to access educational apps and short videos. ;The study concludes that excessive use of smartphones and tablets by young children (4 years) predicts later emotional dysregulation and lower academic achievement (specifically mathematics at 8 years). Maternal scaffolding provided only temporary benefits for academic grades (at 6 years) but did not prevent later dysregulation or its negative impact on math grades at 8 years. ;The study investigated maternal scaffolding (parental involvement) in children's screen time activities. It did not detail specific teacher training programs or instructional designs related to the use of these digital tools in a formal educational intervention, as the focus was on home use and its effects. ;The study controlled for child sex, mothers' highest-grade completed, household income, and family structure. Descriptive statistics for maternal ethnicity, marital status, education, and household income were provided. These factors were used as controls or descriptives, but their specific influence as moderators or mediators on the main outcomes was not the central focus of the reported path models beyond the control variables included.;The negative impact of screen time on academic achievements (mathematics) was found to be mediated by emotional dysregulation and was not immediately apparent, showing up at age 8 after earlier high academic performance at age 6. The study highlights that even sub-threshold dysregulation can have a significant mediating role.
